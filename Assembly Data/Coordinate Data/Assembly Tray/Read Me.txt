Each folder represents a single carrier tray. Carrier Trays should have an id number 'sharpie-d' onto them	
	that matches the name of its folder. The contents are described below.
	
'Fiducials' lists the positions of the fiducials relative to the workspace that the carrier tray resides.	
	They are the results of the last time the fiducials were located. Each time the tray is moved these
	coordinates are used to help the gantry move approximately to the new fiducial locations.
	
"Relative Coordinates' lists the positions of the fiducials, locating pins, and syringe loading area as found by the OGP. It does "	
	not matter where and what angle the plate was measured on the OGP. LabVIEW accounts for this as it
	translates the coordinates to its own workspace.
	
	
Corrections' documents the drift of a component during curing. This value is subtracted from the 	
	position that the gantry intends to place the component.
	
	
See legends and excel forms for each.
